# Car-Rental-DB
Database for a Car Rental business made for an university project

This group project was created for a Database Design and Implementation course. Throughout this project we applied knowledge which we gained with lessons and labs. While we created this database we had to take in account the needs of a potential Car Rental shop and how will digitalization improve their bussines. Furthermore, we needed to considered our design to follow the needed standard, namely our database is the Third Normal Form. The result is a database which could be used in the real world.

The documents attached are as it follows:
1. Project proposal - Car rental document outlines the most important design choices
2. Car Rental MySQL Workbench Model 
3. Car Rental Script
